## First Project
The aim of the first project is to publish accurate odometry for an autonomous vehicle
(a small people-carrier) navigating a university campus. Control parameters are received
through a bag file and odometry needs to be published both as Messages and TF.

## Second Project
The second project is based on a small agricultural skid-steering robot navigating
a fairly dynamic office space. It's made up of two main parts:
* **Mapping** -- Build a map of the environment using a planar laser and a multi-plane LIDAR
mounted on the robot.
* **Navigation** -- Simulate the robot having to localize and navigate within the maps computed
previously.
